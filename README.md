# Expandable tool that simplifies BSWs scheduling process for various complex specialties.  

This tool is easily modifiable and can adapt as rules and information evolves.  Programmed to be fast and responsive, it's ideal for fast-paced checkout environments and can help make the entire process for the patient smoother by avoiding and perhaps completely eliminating mistakes.  With less time spent correcting problems, we can improve metrics across the board relating to productivity and patient satisfaction.  Additionally, as new ideas arise, we can expand on what this tool can be capable of.
